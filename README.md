# 🌋 Living the Volcano Nerd Dream: My Tenerife VolcanoCamp Experience

## **November 2025: Geophysics in the Canary Islands**

In November 2025, the first week, I got to live the **volcano nerd dream**. I scored a scholarship from **GeoTenerife Ltd** and dove into their **VolcanoCamp** on **Tenerife, Canary Islands** in Spain. This experience was focused on intensive field training in volcanic mapping, stratigraphy, and eruption dynamics.

One week on a volcanic island sounds fun already, but spending that week crawling around real lava fields, mapping cones, and reading the landscape like a detective? Honestly, I was in my happiest element.

## **🔬 Field Geology**

We weren’t just wandering around, pointing at cool rocks. We were doing proper field geology, mapping flow units, sketching volcanic facies, checking crystal textures, figuring out eruption sequences, and trying to make sense of outcrops that looked like geological puzzle boxes. Tenerife has this wild diversity of volcanic environments, so every day felt like flipping to a new chapter in Earth’s diary. We even participated in the IV Vulcana Symposium on submarine volcanology and emergency management.

## **🚇 Inside the Earth: The Lava Tube System**

But the moment that absolutely blew my mind? **Entering a lava tube system** that felt like the planet had carved a subway just for us. These tubes were huge, long, tall, branching into multiple merged passages. Standing inside them, you can literally trace how lava once rushed through, insulating itself and forming these enormous conduits.

It’s one thing to read about lava tube morphology; it’s another thing to stand inside one and think, **“Yep, molten rock once sprinted through here at terrifying speed.”** Spectacular doesn’t even cover it.

## **📚 Sharpening the Scientific Edge**

By the end of the week, I felt **sharper in volcanic hazard assessment**, better at interpreting volcanic landforms, and more at ease working with an international group of brilliant, slightly obsessed geoscientists. I learned a lot, but I also laughed a lot, sweated a lot, and remembered exactly why I love this science. It was great to be with an amazing bunch of students, ranging from PhD to bachelor's, and to interact with a huge diversity.

## **🌄 On the Summit: Top of Mount Teide**

We cheated a little, took the cable car up to the peak of Mount Teide since we were short on time, but we made up for it by hiking the whole way back down. Seriously, standing at the top of Teide felt like landing on Mars. The air gets thin and sharp, and the wind whips around you, but then the whole island of Tenerife just opens up below. It looks like a massive, 3D map.

What really blows your mind up there is the sheer scale of the volcano. You can literally trace every ancient lava flow, see the remnants of the old crater walls, and spot all the smaller cones. It’s a geological story laid out right in front of you. Staring down into that massive crater, above the clouds, I felt like I was getting a direct read on Earth’s heartbeat. It totally changes your perspective, both as a person and as someone who studies rocks!

## **🌋 IV International VULCANA Symposium**

Another highlight was attending and participating in the IV International VULCANA Symposium on Submarine Volcanology of the Canary Islands. It pulled together researchers who work on everything from seafloor lava dynamics to hazard communication.
It also gave me a chance to share space with scientists and ask the kind of nerdy questions you can only ask when you’re surrounded by people who love this stuff as much as you do.

## **🙏 Huge Thanks**

Huge thanks to **Sharon Backhouse**, **IGNACIO GARCIA**, and **Alexis Schwartz** for making the whole experience unforgettable.
